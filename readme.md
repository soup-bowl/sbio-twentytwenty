# Twentytwenty - Soupbowl Remix
The default [twentytwenty theme][tt] with a few customisations unique to [soupbowl.io][sb].

## Summary
* Hides homepage title, and removes padding to permit use of a header cover as a title.
* Switched to sans-serif fonts used globally.
* 404 pages have a random message & a [GIPHY][gip] background ([example][sb4]).
  * As of 1.2.1, you can now customise the search term.
* Apple inspired login theme ([example][sbl]).

## GIF 404
The 404 page is replaced with a full screen (excl. header/footer) banner GIF, provided for free by the [Giphy API][gip]. A message is also shown under the 404 page, sourced randomly from the 404-msg.json.

The API key and search terms can be added in Customiser, under the 'Soupy's Extras' segment.
